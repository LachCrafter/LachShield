LachShield is a Minecraft Paper plugin designed to limit the number of player accounts that can join the server from the same IP address.

## Features

- Limits the number of player accounts per IP address to three.
- Players attempting to join with a fourth account from the same IP address will be kicked with a message.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release of the plugin from the [Releases](https://github.com/LachCrafter/LachShield/releases) section.
2. Place the downloaded JAR file into the `plugins` folder of your Minecraft server.
3. Restart or reload your server to enable the plugin.

## Usage

Once the plugin is installed, it will automatically monitor player logins and keep track of the number of accounts from each IP address. If a player attempts to join with a fourth account from the same IP address, they will be kicked from the server with a message indicating the account limit has been exceeded.
